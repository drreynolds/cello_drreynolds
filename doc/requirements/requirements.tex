%    1. Introduction
% 
%          1. Purpose
% 
% <Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.>
% 
%          2. Document Conventions
% 
% <Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.>
% 
%          3. Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
% 
% <Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.>
% 
%          4. Project Scope
% 
% <Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here. An SRS that specifies the next release of an evolving product should contain its own scope statement as a subset of the long-term strategic product vision.>
% 
%          5. References
% 
% <List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.>
% 
%    2. Overall Description
% 
%          1. Product Perspective
% 
% <Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.>
% 
%          2. Product Features
% 
% <Summarize the major features the product contains or the significant functions that it performs or lets the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary  is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or a class diagram, is often effective.>
% 
%          3. User Classes and Characteristics
% 
% <Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those who are less important to satisfy.>

% <Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer-F¢s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>-A
% 
%          6. User Documentation
% 
% <List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.>
% 
%          7. Assumptions and Dependencies
% 
% <List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>
% 
%    3. System Features
% 
% <This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product.

\item[W009] Require that all stored data be accessed through standard
  interface functions that are independent of specific file formats
  (i.e., stored datasets are conceptually treated as objects)
%
\item[W010] Support both structured AMR (Enzo-like) and tree-based AMR
%
\item[W011] Store particle positions in single precision as -1 <=
  x,y,z <= 1 relative to their containing patch
%
\item[W012] Do not store a patch's global position, only local
  position relative to immediate neighbors, parent, and children
%
\item[W013] Represent patch extents with (small) integer values
  relative to parent
%
\item[W014] Provide (or notify) neighboring patches with updated ghost
  zone data as soon as it's available
%
\item[W015] Support optional variable timestep sizes within each level
%
\item[W016] Support optional uniform timesteps across all levels
%
\item[W017] User-controlled optional floor/ceiling limits on
  individual Fields (ala "tiny\_number" in Enzo), with user-specified
  Error behavior (warning, error, ignore, reset to given
  floor/ceiling, etc.)
%
\item[W018] Allow multiple root-level patches per MPI task
%
\item[W019] Use a binary tree data-structure to recursively partition
  the bounding boxes of particles
%
\item[W020] For very deep AMR where coarser levels never complete
  their timestep, delete coarse levels to free storage
%
\item[W021] Relax rigid refinement criteria to inhibit excessive
  changes in octree-like tree refinement
%
\item[W022] Support for user-supplied code for problem initialization
%
\item[W023] Load-balance by having over-loaded processors reassign
  tasks to random processes
%
\item[W024] Load-balance using "over-compensation", since
  heavily-loaded processes tend to continue to become more heavily
  loaded (cosmology / star-formation application-dependent)
%
\item[W025] Reduce tree-AMR node size by only storing parent, single
  neighbor, and single child
%
\item[W026] Support flexible node types: memory-efficient versus
  compute-efficient
%
\item[W027] Support temporary "allocate as-needed" ghost zones in
  addition to "permanent" ones
%
\item[W028] Only use inter-core, inter-cpu, inter-node, etc.
  level-communicators to bound communicator size and manage
  communication nonuniformity
