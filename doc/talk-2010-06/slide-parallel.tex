\item\enzo\ grid patches proceed level-by-level
\begin{itemize}
\item   Static scheduling based on W-cycle through levels
\item   Bryan: ``refined patches work to catch up to their neighbors''
\item   Introduces artificial data dependencies
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item      e.g. at first step, \textit{all} grids could advance
\item      slow localized region of domain can slow down entire simulation
\end{itemize}
\item\cello: patches advance dynamically
\begin{itemize}
\item   Bordner: ``patches work to get ahead of their neighbors''
\item   Dynamic scheduling based on data dependencies with neighbors
\begin{itemize}
\item     a patch can advance when all of its neighbors have caught up
\item     more forgiving for large processor counts
\end{itemize}
