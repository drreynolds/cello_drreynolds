Code for components are organized into separate directories.

== Software Component Dependencies ==

Software components necessarily depend on one another, but their dependencies should be well-defined and kept minimal.  There should be no loops in the dependency graph.  Dependencies are represented in the code using "#include" statements.  In general, "fan out" is bad (when one component depends on many other components), but fan-in is ok (when many other components depend on one component).
