|| ( ) || [NotesComponentTask Task] || Encapsulates `Methods` and data that are distributed using `Parallel` and scheduled to run using `Control` ||


Code for components are organized into separate directories.

== Software Component Dependencies ==

Software components necessarily depend on one another, but their dependencies should be well-defined and kept minimal.  There should be no loops in the dependency graph.  Dependencies are represented in the code using "#include" statements.
