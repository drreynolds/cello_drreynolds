\textbf{Project Summary}

% Cello + Enzo-II
%
%   formalization of Enzo-P development as a physics application built
%   on a new independent extreme AMR framework
%
%
%
This project proposes to develop \cello, a new parallel adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) software framework.  The purpose of \cello\ is to
enable researchers to write multi-physics AMR applications that can
harness the enormous computing power of current and future world-class
HPC platforms.  The distinguishing characteristic relative to existing
AMR frameworks is the aggressive pursuit at the onset of extreme
scalability, both in terms of software data structures and hardware
parallelism.
%
Integral to developing \cello\ will be developing \enzoii, a petascale
astrophysics and cosmology application built on top of the \cello\
framework.  \enzoii\ will not only help drive development of the
underlying \cello\ framework, but it will serve as a petascalable
variant of the \enzo\ terascale astrophysics and cosmology community
code.  Both the \enzoii\ science application, and the underlying
independent \cello\ parallel AMR software framework, will be released
and supported as community software.

\textit{Software sustainability} will be realized under the dual
support of the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (LCA) at the
University of California San Diego, and the San Diego Supercomputer
Center, organizations devoted to the long-term maintenance of---and
user support for---community scientific codes and HPC software
infrastructures, respectively.
%
\textit{Software self-management} will be an integral component of the
\cello\ software design, with software resilience a high priority.
The \cello\ framework will be designed to detect hardware and software
faults, identify performance and numerical issues, and dynamically
reconfigure to always perform with the highest possible efficiency on
currently available hardware components.
%
\textit{Energy efficiency} can be considered implicit in the
underlying adaptive mesh refinement approach, which dynamically
targets computational resources where they are required, and avoids
expending resources where they are not.  The adaptivity of AMR
translates directly to energy savings.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The proposed AMR framework would enable application
% developers to write multiphysics applications for simulating phenomena
% on an unprecedented range of spacial and temporal scales.

% AMR will be implemented using a modified octree-based approach.  Nodes
% of an octree will be associated with both logically Cartesian grid
% blocks and groups of particles, for Eulerian, Lagrangian, and hybrid
% methods for solving coupled hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic PDE's.
% Unlike standard octree-based AMR, grid block sizes may vary, and
% individual blocks may be distributed, such that optimal ``unigrid''
% parallel performance is recovered in subregions of the problem domain
% that are smooth.  Additionally, higher refinement factors, such as
% $r=4$ or even $r=8$, will be supported for particularly ``deep'' AMR
% problems; this will be designed in a way that still maintains at most
% $r=2$ level jumps, and will retain the high efficiency of the octree
% data structure.

% Parallelization will be primarily data parallel, with task
% parallelization also available to augment the data parallelism.  A
% variety of parallelization technologies will be supported from the
% start, beginning with the message-driven processor virtualization
% approach provided by the
% \charm\ framework~\cite{KaBo07}~\cite{wwwcharm}.  Other
% parallelization methods used will include one-sided message passing
% via the MPI-2.0 library~\cite{wwwmpi}, the partitioned global address
% space (PGAS) approach via the UPC language~\cite{wwwupc}~\cite{upc},
% and shared memory parallel programming using the OpenMP
% API~\cite{wwwopenmp}.  Hybrid parallelism will be supported, including
% MPI with OpenMP and UPC with MPI.  Dynamic load balancing of parallel
% tasks will include hierarchical methods, which will improve mapping
% the distributed software data structures to the hierarchical hardware
% components of HPC platforms.

% Fault tolerance and software resilience are also crucial factors at
% extreme scales.  The checkpoint-to-disk paradigm is known to be
% ultimately non-scalable, so this project will support other alternatives,
% including checkpoint-to-memory, or other options as they become
% technologically feasible.  Our framework will be designed at the onset
% to be resistant to memory, compute component, network, disk, and
% software failures.
% 
% This project plans to make the framework and accompanying documentation freely
% available for use by the research community.  The result of this
% project will be a software framework that allows application
% developers to write multiphysics applications for simulating phenomena
% on an unprecedented range of spacial and temporal scales for many
% years to come.

% The proposed AMR framework would enable application
% developers to write
