 *	(i.e., WHAT does this function do?)
 *
 * NOTE: If the file contains multiple functions, the information below

 *
 * Input:
 *	Describe outside input from the user or from a file.  If the
 *      formal parameter names and function pre-condition do not
 *	adequately document the input parameters, then further
 *	documentation should appear here.
 *
 * Output:
 *	Describe output written to the console or to a file.  If the
 *      formal parameter names, function post-condition, and returns

 * Implementation:
 *	Describe interesting implementation details here, if any.
