/// @brief    [\ref Main] Declaration of the Main CHARM++ chare
///
/// Different test programs require different subsets of existing chares.
/// For example, lower-level test programs, e.g. Mesh or Field tests,
/// don't need to (and shouldn't) include Enzo-specific chare declarations.
/// main.hpp is an include file used with CHARM.  Four "levels" of
/// chare's are included:
///
///     CHARM_ENZO:       include Enzo, Simulation, and Mesh chare declartions
///     CHARM_SIMULATION: include Simulation, and Mesh chare declarations
///     CHARM_MESH:       include Mesh component chare declarations
///     <default>         don't include any chare declarations
