/// @brief    [\ref Mesh] Declaration of the NodeInfo class
///
/// The NodeInfo class is used for storing information about a Node
/// that isn't stored in the Node class itself, but computable given
/// the Tree.  This may include node level, hierarchy refinement level
/// (which may be different from Tree node level), Node trace from
/// Tree root, etc.  Some information may be computed on an as-needed
/// basis.
