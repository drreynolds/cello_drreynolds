Version 0.5b5  2012-09-06 [+344 changesets]

  This is the first release in 10 months, and includes too many
  changes to summarize.  Much of the effort has been in implementing
  checkpoint / restart in a way that would work for both MPI and
  Charm++; however, this was abandoned in favor of using Charm++'s
  built-in support for checkpoint / restart, which required writing
  about 76 "packing" functions.  This effectively makes Cello a
  Charm++-only code rather than Charm++ and MPI, though MPI code is
  still present.  Restart capability is still being debugged, but will
  be available ASAP.  Innumerable other additions, bug fixes, and
  changes have been made, including restructuring the file layout to
  src/Cello and src/Enzo subdirectories.

Version 0.5b4  2011-12-08 [+54 changesets]

  This update fixes a lot of errors that became apparent when testing
  on Intel and PGI compilers in addition to GNU.

  * FIX:     Fixed Cello-to-HDF5 axis-reversal OutputData bug
  * FIX:     Fixed function call sequence so that ghosts are refreshed
             before boundary conditions are enforced
  * FIX:     Added barrier after enforcing initial conditions to prevent
             error due to CHARM++ race conditions
  * Fix:     Fixed Intel serial link bug
  * Fix:     Fixed colormap bug
  * Change:  Initialize field data with -MAX(float)
  * Change:  Replaced 1e-20 with 1e-10 for single precision to avoid 
             underflow in PPML_monot.F
  * Change:  Added support for communicating edge and vertex ghosts as well 
             as faces
  * Change:  Added Field:refresh_edges and Field:refresh_corners parameters
  * Change:  Changed temp_update_all to true and temp_update_full to false in
             all input files
  * Change:  Moved PPML temporary array allocation from Fortran stack to 
             C++ heap to avoid stack overflow in PPML_MAIN.F
